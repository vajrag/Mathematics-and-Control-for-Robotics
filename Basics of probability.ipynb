    "1\\. A box contains 100 soda bottles and 100 beer bottles. A robot needs to retreive a soda bottle from the box, but it cannot recognize the bottles while they are in the box; therefore, it has to grasp bottles from the box randomly and place them on the table before performing object recognition. Since object recognition is an expensive operation, the robot only performs this once it is fairly confident it has already placed a soda bottle on the table. How many bottles does it need to move from the box to the table before it can be at least 99.99% sure it has placed at least one soda bottle on the table?"
